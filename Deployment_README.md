## Deployment

### Creating the workspace
I have created both my FrontEnd and the BackEnd in the same workspace. All instructions that follow are for a combined workspace using GITPOD. If you have your Backend in a separate workspace or use CodeAnywhere, this is not the correct way to continue and some thing might differ.



Create the Backend








#### Creating the Heroku app


---
## Github Pages
- This project was developed using Gitpod which I used to commit and push to GitHub using the terminal in GitPod.(Note that this project was deployed to Heroku and that those steps also must be followed.)
### Here are the steps to deploy a website to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository, locate the Settings button on the menu.
- Under Source, click the dropdown called None and select Main Branch.
- The page will refresh automatically and generate a link to your website.
### Forking the GitHub Repository
- By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
### Making a Local Clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
