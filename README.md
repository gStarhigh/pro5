# React project (Project Portfolio 5, Advanced FrontEnd) for Code Institute.

## General information
Equestrians Together is an online page for equestrians. The original idea, and the idea behind the site, is that those who have their horse in our (IRL) stable, can share images and information with one another to ease their communication and easier share their experiences with one another.

This website was created with a "mobile view first" idea, which means that I believe that the users of this site will to the most part use it through a mobile device.

The website has full CRUD functionality, which means that users can:

- Create a post, comment, information post, or contact form.
- View a post, comment, information post, or contact form.
- Edit a post, comment, information post, or contact form.
- Delete a post, comment, information post, or contact form.


This project was created within a deadline and I have alot of ideas I want to implement going forward, but due to a short timetable some features had to be left out. You can read more about this [here](#Future-improvements-1).

## Github Pages
- This project was developed using Gitpod which I used to commit and push to GitHub using the terminal in GitPod.(Note that this project was deployed to Heroku and that those steps also must be followed.)
### Here are the steps to deploy a website to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository, locate the Settings button on the menu.
- Under Source, click the dropdown called None and select Main Branch.
- The page will refresh automatically and generate a link to your website.
### Forking the GitHub Repository
- By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
### Making a Local Clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
